__**Rules**__

First, I recommend you familiarize yourself with Discord's Guidelines: https://discord.com/new/guidelines

Likewise, here are some general rules I borrowed from a nice Gist: https://gist.github.com/Ryonez/ea992e49d4923980426b0128603fd42f

:small_blue_diamond: No racism or hate speech
:small_blue_diamond: No NSFW content
:small_blue_diamond: No offensive nicknames
:small_blue_diamond: No publishing of personal information (including real names, addresses, emails, passwords, bank account and credit card information, etc.)
:small_blue_diamond: No gatekeeping or elitism

In general, I'd like for this to be a compassionate space where folks can have safe discussions about whatever.  

If there are any rules you'd like to see feel free to share your #suggestions.
